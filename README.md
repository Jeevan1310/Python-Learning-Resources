# Python Programming Language

## üíª Introduction

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted **high-level general-purpose programming language**. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Scrimba

**[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)** is the next-generation platform for learning how to code. It is an interactive learning platform for mainly frontend developers. But they recently started adding courses for the backend as well. The screencasts enable learners to interact with the code directly in the player. The content on Scrimba is a mix between community generated tutorials, and courses initiated by the Scrimba team itself.

Some of them are:

# **Example Programs**
## **1.Hello World Program**
Its a simple program  that describes how to input your name , age , designation and your three skills.You can workout this program as ice breaking one..
#### Source Code
```ino 
print("welcome to world of coding")
print("please fill the details")
name=input("enter your name -")
age=input("enter your age -")
designation=input("enter your designation -")
list=[]
for i in range(3):
    skills=input("please enter your skills:\n")
    list.append(skills)
print("my name is :",name)
print("my age is :",age)
print("I am ",designation)
print('i am mastered in ',*list,sep= "," )
```
#### output
![output 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81223681/135761760-e09c79ac-3ee4-4cfd-996d-cc11811a12e6.png)

## **2.Multiplication Table Program**
Yeah! Ice breaked come on lets do an another program.This program is also a simple program but try it to ensure you are a good learner..
#### Source Code
```ino 
num=int(input("enter the nuber :"))
if (num%2)==0:
    print("{0} is even number".format(num))
    print ("multiplication table ")
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(num,'x',i,'=',num*i)
else:
    print("{0} is odd number".format(num))
    print ("multiplication table ")
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(num,'x',i,'=',num*i)
```
#### output

## **3.Pattern Printing Program**
Lets Go to next program , In the next program we will  print a simple pattern 
#### Source Code
```ino 
rows=int(input("Enter the number of rows :"))
for i in range(0, rows):
    for j in range(0, i + 1):
        print("#", end=' ')
    print("\r")

for i in range(rows, 0, -1):
    for j in range(0, i - 1):
        print("#", end=' ')
    print("\r")

```
#### output

## **4.Calculator Program**
In this program we program a calculator that will do operations like

- 1.Addition
- 2.Substraction
- 3.Multiplication
-  3.Division
-  4.Square root of a number
- 5.Power of a Number

So lets go to the program..
#### Source Code
```ino 
print("Lets start calculating...")
def script():
    # define functions  
    def add(x, y):  
        return x + y 
    def subtract(x, y): 
        return x - y 
    def multiply(x, y):  
        return x * y 
    def divide(x, y): 
        return x / y 
    def percentage(x,y):
        return (x/y)*100
    def squart(x):
        return 
    def power(x,y):
        return
    print("Select operation.")  
    print("1.Add")  
    print("2.Subtract")  
    print("3.Multiply")  
    print("4.Divide")
    print("5.percentage")
    print("6.squareroot")
    print("7.power of n") 
  
    choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4/5/6/7):")  
  
    num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))  
    num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))  
  
    if choice == '1':  
        print(num1,"+",num2,"=", add(num1,num2))  
    elif choice == '2':  
        print(num1,"-",num2,"=", subtract(num1,num2))  
  
    elif choice == '3':  
        print(num1,"*",num2,"=", multiply(num1,num2))  
    elif choice == '4':  
        print(num1,"/",num2,"=", divide(num1,num2))
    elif choice == '5':
        print("percentage=",percentage(num1,num2),"%")
    elif choice == '6':
        number = int(input("enter a number: "))
        sqrt = number ** 0.5
        print("square root:", sqrt)
    elif choice == '7':
        num = int(input("Enter the number of which you have to find power: "))
        pw = int(input("Enter the power: "))
        kj = 1
        for n in range(pw):
            kj = kj*num
        print(kj)
    else:  
        print("Invalid input") 
    restart =input("Would you like to continue ")
    if restart == "yes" or restart == "y":
            script()
    if restart == "n" or restart == "no":
            print ("Thank you for using me")
script()

```

## **5.Password Generator**
Lets Create a password Generator using Python . Compared to other programs this program is a difficult one .

#### Source Code
```ino 
print("DO YOU NEED PASSWORDS ? ")
print("I-N-O-S-A-F-E is here! lets make new passwords that improve your security. ")
def script():
    def restart():
        return 
    import random
    chars="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    chars1="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890"
    chars2="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*"
    print("Select password type.")  
    print("1.Standard")  
    print("2.Secure")  
    print("3.Ultra")
    choice = input("Enter your choice(1/2/3):")
    number=int(1)
    length=int(16)
    if choice == '1': 
        for p in range(number):
            password="INO_"
        for c in range(length):
                password += random.choice(chars)
        print(password)
    elif choice == '2':
        for p in range(number):
            password="INO_"
        for c in range(length):
                password += random.choice(chars1)
        print(password)
    elif choice == '3':
        for p in range(number):
            password="INO_"
        for c in range(length):
                password += random.choice(chars2)
        print(password)
    else:  
        print("Invalid input") 
    restart =input("Would you like to continue ")
    if restart == "yes" or restart == "y":            
             script()
    if restart == "n" or restart == "no":
            print ("Thank you for using me")
script()

```

## **6.Age Calculator**
We created a calculator  previously with all operations. But in this program we create a Age calculator in which use input his date of birth and user will get age in output. what are yow waiting lets do this..
#### Source Code
```ino 
from datetime import datetime, date
  
born=input("Enter your date of birth  in  the format(DD/MM/YYYY) :")
print("Your  date of birth is  ",born)
  
born = datetime.strptime(born, "%d/%m/%Y").date()
  
today = date.today()
print("Yeah It is true!")
print("You are",
      today.year - born.year - ((today.month,
                                          today.day) < (born.month,
                                                        born.day)),"years,",today.month - born.month -((today.year,
                                                                    today.day) < (born.year,born.day)),"month and",(today.day - born.day or born.day - today.day) -((today.month,
                                                                                     today.year) < (born.month,born.year)),"days old")

```

## **7.Guess the Number Game **
In this Example program we are going to create a Guess the number game Its logic is simple so lets check it out
#### Source Code
```ino 
import random

print("wekcome to guessing game ")
num = random.randint(1, 10)
guess = None

while guess != num:
    guess = input("guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
    guess = int(guess)

    if guess == num:
        print("congratulations! you won!")
        break
    else:
        print("nope, sorry. try again!")

```
