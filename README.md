# Python Programming Language

## üíª Introduction

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an interpreted **high-level general-purpose programming language**. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Scrimba

**[Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)** is the next-generation platform for learning how to code. It is an interactive learning platform for mainly frontend developers. But they recently started adding courses for the backend as well. The screencasts enable learners to interact with the code directly in the player. The content on Scrimba is a mix between community generated tutorials, and courses initiated by the Scrimba team itself.

Some of them are:

- üî∞ [Python Basics](https://scrimba.com/playlist/peaXwtB) (9 Interactive Screencasts)

# **Example Programs**
## **1.Hello World Program**
Its a simple program  that describes how to input your name , age , designation and your three skills.You can workout this program as ice breaking one..
#### Source Code
```ino 
print("welcome to world of coding")
print("please fill the details")
name=input("enter your name -")
age=input("enter your age -")
designation=input("enter your designation -")
list=[]
for i in range(3):
    skills=input("please enter your skills:\n")
    list.append(skills)
print("my name is :",name)
print("my age is :",age)
print("I am ",designation)
print('i am mastered in ',*list,sep= "," )
```
#### output
![output 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81223681/135761760-e09c79ac-3ee4-4cfd-996d-cc11811a12e6.png)

## **2.Multiplication Table Program**
Yeah! Ice breaked come on lets do an another program.This program is also a simple program but try it to ensure you are a good learner..
#### Source Code
```ino 
num=int(input("enter the nuber :"))
if (num%2)==0:
    print("{0} is even number".format(num))
    print ("multiplication table ")
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(num,'x',i,'=',num*i)
else:
    print("{0} is odd number".format(num))
    print ("multiplication table ")
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(num,'x',i,'=',num*i)
```
#### output

## **3.Pattern Printing Program**
Lets Go to next program , In the next program we will  print a simple pattern 
#### Source Code
```ino 
rows=int(input("Enter the number of rows :"))
for i in range(0, rows):
    for j in range(0, i + 1):
        print("#", end=' ')
    print("\r")

for i in range(rows, 0, -1):
    for j in range(0, i - 1):
        print("#", end=' ')
    print("\r")

```
#### output
![output 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81223681/135836979-2cc3605e-ba5f-4b30-ad9d-35a669ccaa7f.png)

## **4.Calculator Program**
In this program we program a calculator that will do operations like

- 1.Addition
- 2.Substraction
- 3.Multiplication
-  3.Division
-  4.Square root of a number
- 5.Power of a Number

So lets go to the program..
#### Source Code
```ino 
print("Lets start calculating...")
def script():
    # define functions  
    def add(x, y):  
        return x + y 
    def subtract(x, y): 
        return x - y 
    def multiply(x, y):  
        return x * y 
    def divide(x, y): 
        return x / y 
    def percentage(x,y):
        return (x/y)*100
    def squart(x):
        return 
    def power(x,y):
        return
    print("Select operation.")  
    print("1.Add")  
    print("2.Subtract")  
    print("3.Multiply")  
    print("4.Divide")
    print("5.percentage")
    print("6.squareroot")
    print("7.power of n") 
  
    choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4/5/6/7):")  
  
    num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))  
    num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))  
  
    if choice == '1':  
        print(num1,"+",num2,"=", add(num1,num2))  
    elif choice == '2':  
        print(num1,"-",num2,"=", subtract(num1,num2))  
  
    elif choice == '3':  
        print(num1,"*",num2,"=", multiply(num1,num2))  
    elif choice == '4':  
        print(num1,"/",num2,"=", divide(num1,num2))
    elif choice == '5':
        print("percentage=",percentage(num1,num2),"%")
    elif choice == '6':
        number = int(input("enter a number: "))
        sqrt = number ** 0.5
        print("square root:", sqrt)
    elif choice == '7':
        num = int(input("Enter the number of which you have to find power: "))
        pw = int(input("Enter the power: "))
        kj = 1
        for n in range(pw):
            kj = kj*num
        print(kj)
    else:  
        print("Invalid input") 
    restart =input("Would you like to continue ")
    if restart == "yes" or restart == "y":
            script()
    if restart == "n" or restart == "no":
            print ("Thank you for using me")
script()

```
